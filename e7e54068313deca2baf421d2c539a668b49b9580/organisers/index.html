    <h2>Hannah Heil</h2>
    <p>
        Hannah is a postdoctoral researcher in the Optical Cell Biology Lab (https://henriqueslab.github.io/) at Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine (GIMM, www.gimm.pt ) in Oeiras, Portugal. Coming from a biophotonics and high-end microscopy development background, Hannah is driven by an interest in biological phenomena that impact human health. At the IGC she is part of an interdisciplinary team of Physicists, Mathematicians and Biologists who are striving to observe and decipher the mechanistic pathways of virus entry and their role in the infection outcome. To get new insights into these phenomena she is developing and advancing super-resolution techniques towards live-cell microscopy to study host pathogen interactions at a molecular level. What is especially important to her is to provide accessible, transferable, open-source technologies, for example by open-hardware designs that can be 3D printed.

    <h2>Benedict Diederich</h2>

    <p>
        Frustrated with always having to invent optical setups from scratch, and inspired by rapid prototyping tools in electronics, Benedict is trying to make optics and microscopy a standard tool for everyone. Always curious about problems and their solutions, he is the tinkerer behind optics, electronics, software and beyond. Co-Founder of openUC2.com and group-leader of the Open Instrumentation Group (JOIN) at the Jena Instute of Photonic Technologies, Jena, Germany.

    <h2>Jorge Carvalho</h2>
    <p> 
        Jorge Carvalho has a cross-disciplinary experience in the fields of bioengineering, chemistry, biophysics and materials science, focused on the development of miniaturized and microfluidics technologies with applications in environment, industry and health. First, Jorge worked in biocatalysis at Lund University, economically optimising the amidation of olein fatty acid using different small-scale enzyme reactors. During his PhD, within the MIT-Portugal doctoral program, he designed and fabricated different impedance biosensors integrated with milli- and microfluidics for the characterization of biomolecular interactions kinetics and viscoelasticity. At Gulbenkian Science, he was co-responsible for the implementation of a method for the manipulation of cellular content for biophysical and mechanobiology studies using as biological models the Drosophila egg chambers and embryos, where he contributed for the understanding of physical principles behind their intracellular organisation. Since 2020, he became responsible for setting up a Bioengineering Microfabrication core facility at Gulbenkian Science, now part of the Scientific Platform - Bioimaging â€“ Prototyping of the new Gulbenkian Institute for Molecular Medicine. The portfolio of services includes microfluidics devices, surface micropatterning for in vitro studies, small lab equipment, miscellaneous parts and tools for applications in life sciences research
