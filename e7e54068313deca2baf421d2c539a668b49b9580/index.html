    <h2>Welcome to Hack Your Microscope 2025!</h2>
    <p>
        Join us for a week-long, hands-on journey into the world of modular, open-source microscopy. This workshop is designed to push the boundaries of traditional imaging by empowering participants to build and customize their own microscopes. With challenges in organoid sorting, bacteria staining, and advanced image processing, this course is perfect for those eager to innovate and create outside their comfort zone.
    </p>
    <p>
        Discover how to design powerful imaging tools with 3D printing, microfluidics, and open hardwareâ€”all while connecting with experts and fellow makers from around the world. From technical workshops to creative design sessions, this event will help you turn ideas into instruments. Whether you're a biologist, engineer, or just curious about microscopy, Hack Your Microscope is the place to explore, learn, and contribute to the future of accessible imaging.
